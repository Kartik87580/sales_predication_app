# ðŸ“¢ Advertisement Click Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning web app that predicts whether a user will **click on an advertisement** or not, based on features like **age**, **daily internet usage**, **timestamp**, etc. Built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Features Used

* Daily Time Spent on Site
* Age
* Area Income
* Daily Internet Usage
* Timestamp (can be processed into hour/day)
* Gender (if included)
* Clicked on Ad (Target)

---

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ for data analysis
* **Scikit-learn** â€“ for ML models and preprocessing
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ for visualization (if included)
* **Streamlit** â€“ for deploying interactive web app

---

## ðŸ§ª ML Model

* **Logistic Regression** or any suitable classification model
* Target variable: `Clicked on Ad` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## ðŸ§  Model Workflow

1. Data loaded and preprocessed
2. Features selected and target encoded
3. Trained using classification algorithm
4. User input taken via Streamlit UI
5. Model predicts probability of clicking the ad
